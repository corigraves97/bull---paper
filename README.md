## Background:
Bull & Paper came about when a couple of the developers got together and realized we had a shared interest in trading. We decided what would be useful for us is an app that could track the trades we are making daily, returning profit loss data to see where us traders can grow our earnings and which trades to avoid.

Developers: Cori Graves, Kiesha Walker, Paul Kniaz
